commit 3e88866dc60b5fa6aaba6fd7c1710c12c1c3cd01

    Prevent possible IMAP MITM via PREAUTH response.
    
    This is similar to CVE-2014-2567 and CVE-2020-12398.  STARTTLS is not
    allowed in the Authenticated state, so previously Mutt would
    implicitly mark the connection as authenticated and skip any
    encryption checking/enabling.
    
    No credentials are exposed, but it does allow messages to be sent to
    an attacker, via postpone or fcc'ing for instance.
    
    Reuse the $ssl_starttls quadoption "in reverse" to prompt to abort the
    connection if it is unencrypted.
    
    Thanks very much to Damian Poddebniak and Fabian Ising from the
    MÃ¼nster University of Applied Sciences for reporting this issue, and
    their help in testing the fix.
