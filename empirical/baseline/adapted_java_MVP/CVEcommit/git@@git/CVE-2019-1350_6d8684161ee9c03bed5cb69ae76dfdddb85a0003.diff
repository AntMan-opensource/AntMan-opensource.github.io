    mingw: fix quoting of arguments
    
    We need to be careful to follow proper quoting rules. For example, if an
    argument contains spaces, we have to quote them. Double-quotes need to
    be escaped. Backslashes need to be escaped, but only if they are
    followed by a double-quote character.
    
    We need to be _extra_ careful to consider the case where an argument
    ends in a backslash _and_ needs to be quoted: in this case, we append a
    double-quote character, i.e. the backslash now has to be escaped!
    
    The current code, however, fails to recognize that, and therefore can
    turn an argument that ends in a single backslash into a quoted argument
    that now ends in an escaped double-quote character. This allows
    subsequent command-line parameters to be split and part of them being
    mistaken for command-line options, e.g. through a maliciously-crafted
    submodule URL during a recursive clone.
    
    Technically, we would not need to quote _all_ arguments which end in a
    backslash _unless_ the argument needs to be quoted anyway. For example,
    `test\` would not need to be quoted, while `test \` would need to be.
    
    To keep the code simple, however, and therefore easier to reason about
    and ensure its correctness, we now _always_ quote an argument that ends
    in a backslash.
    
    This addresses CVE-2019-1350.
