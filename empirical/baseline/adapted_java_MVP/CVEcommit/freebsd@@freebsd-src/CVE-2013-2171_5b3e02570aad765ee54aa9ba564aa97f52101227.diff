Author: Dag-Erling Sm√∏rgrav <des@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 18 07:02:35 2013 +0000

    Fix a bug that allowed a tracing process (e.g. gdb) to write
    to a memory-mapped file in the traced process's address space
    even if neither the traced process nor the tracing process had
    write access to that file.
    
    Security:       CVE-2013-2171
    Security:       FreeBSD-SA-13:06.mmap
    Approved by:    so
