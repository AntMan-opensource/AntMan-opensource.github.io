    appletalk: Fix Use-After-Free in atalk_ioctl
    
    Because atalk_ioctl() accesses sk->sk_receive_queue
    without holding a sk->sk_receive_queue.lock, it can
    cause a race with atalk_recvmsg().
    A use-after-free for skb occurs with the following flow.
    ```
    atalk_ioctl() -> skb_peek()
    atalk_recvmsg() -> skb_recv_datagram() -> skb_free_datagram()
    ```
    Add sk->sk_receive_queue.lock to atalk_ioctl() to fix this issue.
