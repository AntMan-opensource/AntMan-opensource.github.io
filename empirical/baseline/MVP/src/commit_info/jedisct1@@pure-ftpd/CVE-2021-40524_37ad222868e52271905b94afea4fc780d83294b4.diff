commit 37ad222868e52271905b94afea4fc780d83294b4

    Initialize the max upload file size when quotas are enabled
    
    Due to an unwanted check, files causing the quota to be exceeded
    were deleted after the upload, but not during the upload.
    
    The bug was introduced in 2009 in version 1.0.23
    
    Spotted by @DroidTest, thanks!
