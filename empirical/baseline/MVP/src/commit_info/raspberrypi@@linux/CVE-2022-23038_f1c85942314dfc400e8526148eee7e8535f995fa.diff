    xen/scsifront: don't use gnttab_query_foreign_access() for mapped status
    
    Commit 33172ab50a53578a95691310f49567c9266968b0 upstream.
    
    It isn't enough to check whether a grant is still being in use by
    calling gnttab_query_foreign_access(), as a mapping could be realized
    by the other side just after having called that function.
    
    In case the call was done in preparation of revoking a grant it is
    better to do so via gnttab_try_end_foreign_access() and check the
    success of that operation instead.
    
    This is CVE-2022-23038 / part of XSA-396.
